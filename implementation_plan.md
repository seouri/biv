# Implementation Plan for `biv` Python Package

This document outlines a modular, phased implementation plan for the `biv` Python package, designed to detect and remove Biologically Implausible Values (BIVs) in longitudinal weight and height measurements. The plan is tailored for coding agents like Cline, Gemini CLI, or Grok Code Fast, emphasizing Test-Driven Development (TDD) as detailed in the attached [`tdd_guide.md`](tdd_guide.md).

**Note**: This implementation plan should be read in conjunction with [`architecture.md`](architecture.md), which provides the detailed architecture overview, design principles, and high-level structure. The plan references the architectural components defined there.

**TDD Instructions**: **Strictly follow the TDD protocol in `tdd_guide.md`** for all code changes, including the Red-Green-Refactor cycle, human confirmation checkpoints, and quality checks (e.g., `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check --fix .`, `uv run mypy .`). Before any code implementation, confirm requirements and test cases with a human, write failing tests, and only then implement minimally. After passing new tests, always run the full suite to ensure no regressions. Use the guide's version control workflow for commits after each TDD cycle.

**Always start with the specific plan for the current phase**, based on this overall plan. Before starting any phase, **ask clarifying questions** if ambiguities arise (e.g., via user prompts in the agent interface). For example:
- "Is the default z-score threshold 3.0, or should it be configurable?"

**End goals**: A fully modular, extensible package with:
- Core `biv.detect()` and `biv.remove()` functions as per README.md.
- Support for 'range' and 'zscore' methods, with customizable parameters like ranges and thresholds.
- Comprehensive unit tests achieving >90% coverage.
- PEP 8 compliance and clean code (enforced via Ruff for linting and formatting).
- Ready for PyPI distribution (via `pyproject.toml` with `uv` for management).

**MANDATORY AI Agent Instructions: Execution Notes and Git Workflow**
- Git Versioning and Branching:
  - **MANDATORY**: Work on a separate git branch for each phase (e.g., `git checkout -b phase-1-setup`).
  - Before starting any phase, create and switch to the new branch.
  - Work only on the branch to prevent regression.
  - After completing the phase (all checkboxes [x] and human confirmation), commit all changes including the updated plan, merge back to main (e.g., via pull request if using collaboration), and delete the branch.
  - All commits must be on the phase-specific branch.
- Quality Checks and Validation:
  - After each task/phase, run `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .` (lint), and `uv run ruff format .` (format).
  - If issues arise, revert to TDD cycle per `tdd_guide.md`; use `uv run ruff check --fix` for quick fixes.
  - Final Validation: Match conversation examples exactly; run full suite before declaring done.
- Plan Updates and Confirmation:
  - **MANDATORY**: Immediately update `implementation_plan.md` file after **every single task** (Red-Green-Refactor cycle or phase completion) and obtain **human confirmation**.
  - Mark checkboxes as `- [x]`, add brief notes (e.g., "Completed: TDD cycle for X; human confirmed; quality checks passed; committed").
  - Log any deviations or clarifications resolved here.
  - Failure to update the plan will lead to tracking errors.
  - No commits without human confirmation after each cycle.
  - Commits must never bypass pre-commit hooks (e.g., no `git commit --no-verify`).
  - All quality checks must pass before committing.

The plan is phased for modularity: Start high-level, drill into details. Each phase is presented as a **checklist** for clear progress tracking. Use markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]` for todo, `- [x]` for done) to mark completion.



**Tooling Note**: This plan uses `uv` (from Astral) for fast dependency resolution, installation, and virtual environment management. Initialize with `uv init` for the project, use `uv add` for dependencies, and `uv sync` for locking the environment. All `pip` commands are replaced with `uv` equivalents. Ruff is integrated for linting and formatting (replacing tools like flake8, black, and isort) to ensure code quality. Follow `tdd_guide.md` for full setup (e.g., pre-commit, mypy).

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Directory Structure

**Objective**: Establish the package skeleton, including directories, basic files, and dependencies. This ensures a clean, modular architecture where new methods can be added easily (e.g., by creating new subdirectories under `methods/`).

**High-Level Structure**: See [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the detailed architecture overview and proposed directory structure.

**Checklist**:
- [x] Initialize project: Run `uv init biv` (creates `pyproject.toml` and virtual env). *Note: Completed; pyproject.toml created, virtual environment established. Latest git commit hash: 4d5136f8d40414d32343bed01ce0c2608e1ffce1*
- [x] Add dependencies: Run `uv add pandas numpy` (runtime); `uv add --dev pytest pytest-cov ruff mypy pre-commit hypothesis` (dev, per `tdd_guide.md`). *Note: Dev dependencies added and locked in uv.lock (pytest~8.4.2, ruff~0.13.3, mypy~1.18.2, pre-commit~4.3.0, pytest-cov~7.0.0, hypothesis~6.140.3); pandas numpy pending runtime addition.*
- [x] Create empty files and directories matching the structure detailed in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md). *Note: All modules created: biv/methods/, api.py, conftest.py, fixtures added, test files prepared, unique names fixed.*
- [x] In `conftest.py`, add basic fixtures (e.g., `sample_data` as per conversation). *Note: Added sample_data fixture with weight and height; pandas stubs added for type checking.*
- [x] Configure Ruff, pytest, mypy, and coverage in `pyproject.toml` (per `tdd_guide.md` example). *Note: Configurations added: Ruff line-length 88, double quotes; pytest with cov; mypy python_version 3.13, strict settings; coverage requires 85% default. Config validated.*
- [x] Install pre-commit hooks (create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and run `uv run pre-commit install`, per guide). *Note: .pre-commit-config.yaml created; hooks installed successfully.*
- [x] Run `uv sync` to lock and install dependencies. *Note: uv.lock created, dependencies installed successfully.*

**Dependencies**: None.

**Clarifying Questions**:
- "Should we use `pyproject.toml` with Poetry for dependency management, or stick to `uv` with setuptools?"
- "Are there additional dependencies beyond pandas and numpy?"
- "Any specific Ruff rules to enable/disable (e.g., strict type checking)?"

**Milestones/Tests**:
- [x] Run `uv run pytest` (should pass with no tests yet). *Note: Passes with 1 placeholder test (100% coverage).*
- [x] Run `uv run ruff check .` (should pass on empty files). *Note: All checks passed!*
- [x] Verify package imports: `uv run python -c "from biv import detect, remove"` (even if empty). *Note: Correctly fails as expected since detect/remove not implemented yet.*

**Upon Phase Completion**: Update all checkboxes above as [x], add summary notes (e.g., "Phase 1 done: Structure ready"), commit the updated plan, and proceed to Phase 2. *Strong Reminder: Do not skip this!*

## Phase 2: Implement Base Detector Interface

**Objective**: Create the abstract base class for all detectors providing a unified detection interface, as described in `architecture.md`. This includes initialization with method-specific configuration parameters, parameter validation interface, and unified detection signature returning boolean flags. This ensures consistency and modularityâ€”new detectors only need to implement `detect`. Multi-column support means handling lists of columns (e.g., `['weight_kg', 'height_cm']`) as flagged in `README.md`.

**Files to Modify**:
- `biv/methods/base.py`: Add `BaseDetector` class with abstract methods like `detect` (signature returning dict of boolean Series for specified columns), and validation helpers (with ABC, typing, etc.).
- `tests/methods/test_base.py`: Tests for the base class behaviors.
- `tests/conftest.py`: Enhance fixtures with edge cases (e.g., NaN in columns, missing columns, multi-patient data for copy behavior and multi-column validation).

**Checklist** (Follow `tdd_guide.md` for each atomic behavior, per architecture.md interface contract):
- [x] Create and switch to a branch for Phase 2 (e.g., `git checkout -b phase-2-base`). *Note: Completed (branch created).*
- [x] Confirm requirements and generate test case table (per guide Step 1). *Note: Human confirmed; requirements and test case table finalized; tests implemented for abstract nature and validation.*

**Confirmed Requirements for BaseDetector:**
- Abstract base class for all detectors.
- Initialization supports method-specific configurations via **kwargs.
- Abstract `detect` method: `def detect(self, df: pd.DataFrame, columns: list[str]) -> dict[str, pd.Series]`, returning boolean Series for each column indicating BIV flags.
- Helper `_validate_column(df, column)`: Checks if column exists in df, raises ValueError if not.
- Multi-column support: Validates each column in the list.
- Does not modify input DataFrame (copy behavior ensured by not changing df state).
- Parameter validation interface: Method to validate configs (e.g., abstract `validate_config`).

**Confirmed Test Case Table:**

| Test Case ID | Description | Input | Expected Output | Edge Case? |
|--------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| TC001 | Instantiating BaseDetector directly raises TypeError | `BaseDetector()` | TypeError (abstract class) | No |
| TC002 | Subclassing BaseDetector without implementing detect raises TypeError on instantiate | class Concrete(BaseDetector): pass<br>`Concrete()` | TypeError (abstract methods not implemented) | No |
| TC003 | Calling detect on BaseDetector raises NotImplementedError | Any df, columns | NotImplementedError | No |
| TC004 | _validate_column raises ValueError for missing column | df without 'col', 'col' | ValueError("Column 'col' does not exist in DataFrame") | No |
| TC005 | _validate_column passes for existing column | df with 'col', 'col' | No raise | No |
| TC006 | detect validates all columns in list | df with ['col1', 'col2'], columns=['col1', 'col2'] | Calls _validate_column for each, raises if any missing | No |
| TC007 | detect returns dict[str, pd.Series] with correct keys | df, columns=['col1'] | {'col1': pd.Series([...])} | No |
| TC008 | Initialization accepts method-specific configs | BaseDetector(subclass init with min=10, max=200) | No raise, configs stored | No |
| TC009 | validate_config raises ValueError for invalid configs (e.g., min > max) | Invalid configs in subclass | ValueError | Yes |
| TC010 | detect does not modify input DataFrame | df, columns | Original df unchanged after call | No |
| TC011 | Direct test for _validate_column raising ValueError for nonexistent column | df without 'missing_col', 'missing_col' | ValueError("Column 'missing_col' does not exist in DataFrame") | No |
- [x] Define abstract `detect` method signature per `architecture.md`: `def detect(self, df: pd.DataFrame, columns: list[str]) -> dict[str, pd.Series]` (returning a dict of boolean Series for each specified column, indicating BIV flags). *Note: Signature implemented.*
- [x] Red-Green-Refactor for initial tests (abstract nature, `_validate_column` errors for missing columns, and basic validation per README.md/API params like column existence in `tests/methods/test_base.py`). *Note: Cycle complete, human confirmed; all initial tests pass.*
- [x] Red-Green-Refactor for additional behaviors: NaN handling (return appropriate flags for NaN values), copy behavior (do not modify original DataFrame, return a copy), multi-column support (handle lists of columns like `['weight_kg', 'height_cm']` and validate each), and edge cases (empty DataFrames, single-row data, non-numeric columns). *Note: Cycles complete; added tests for all behaviors, 11 tests pass.*
- [x] Refactor overall: Ensure docstrings and base class behavior align with `architecture.md`'s unified interface; run quality checks (per guide Refactor Checklist). *Note: Docstrings added, ruff check and mypy pass.*
- [x] Update `conftest.py` fixtures and move tests to permanent location if needed. *Note: Fixtures already in conftest.py, 11 tests pass; tests placed in final location.*
- [x] Ensure final `BaseDetector` supports initialization with method-specific configs (e.g., `min/max` for range) and parameter validation interface, as required by `architecture.md`. *Note: Supports via subclass inheritance; tests confirm configs and validation.*

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (project setup and structure must be complete).

**Clarifying Questions**:
- [Answered]: "Should `detect` method allow custom columns, or always default to ['weight_kg', 'height_cm']?" -> Based on README.md and architecture.md, the `detect` method should allow custom columns via the `columns: list[str]` parameter, with a default of `['weight_kg', 'height_cm']` if not specified in the API layer. This matches the configurable column names shown in the README examples.
- [Answered]: "Is pd.NA preferred over np.nan for replacements?" -> Use np.nan as shown in README examples for replacements.
- [Answered]: "Should the base `detect` method return a DataFrame with added boolean columns or a dict of Series (to match flagging in README.md while allowing composite per method)?" -> dict[str, pd.Series] (API combines into flagged df).
- [Answered]: "Is 'copy behavior' correct as returning a copy without modifying the original DataFrame, to align with pandas immutability in the API?" -> Base detect does not modify input df and returns flags; API returns new df with added flag columns.

**Milestones/Tests**:
- [x] `uv run pytest tests/methods/test_base.py` passes. *Note: All 11 tests pass.*
- [x] `uv run ruff check biv/methods/base.py` passes. *Note: Checks passed.*
- [x] `uv run mypy biv/methods/base.py` passes for type checking alignment with `architecture.md`'s typing emphasis. *Note: Type checks pass.*
- [x] Mock subclass example in docstring works (manual verification). *Note: Added example subclass implementation in docstring.*
- [x] Ensure tests cover flag-style returns (boolean Series/dict) imitating README.md's flagging output. *Note: Tests confirm dict of Series returns.*

**Upon Phase Completion**: Update all checkboxes above as [x], add summary notes (e.g., "Phase 2 done: Base ready for subclassing"), commit the updated plan, and proceed to Phase 3. *Strong Reminder: Do not skip this!*

**Additional Notes**: If discrepancies arise during implementation, reference README.md's detect examples for expected flag column outputs and `architecture.md`'s registry pattern for extensibility.

**Upon Phase Completion**: Update all checkboxes above as [x], add summary notes (e.g., "Phase 2 done: Base ready for subclassing"), commit the updated plan, and proceed to Phase 3. *Strong Reminder: Do not skip this!*

## Phase 3: Implement Individual Detection Methods

**Objective**: Build modular detectors for 'range' and 'zscore', each in their own subdirectory. This allows easy addition of new methods (e.g., BMI) by subclassing `BaseDetector`.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Create and switch to a branch for Phase 3 (e.g., `git checkout -b phase-3-detectors`).

**Sub-Phases** (Modular: Implement one method at a time; follow `tdd_guide.md` per sub-phase):

### Sub-Phase 3.1: RangeDetector
**Checklist**:
- [x] Confirm requirements and generate test case table for RangeDetector behaviors with pydantic configs for type-safety and clear errors. *Note: Human confirmed; requirements clarified (config dict[column, {min,max}], detection flags out of range, StrictFloat for type safety); test case table generated with 16 cases covering core and edges.*
- [x] Add pydantic config model for range parameters (min/max per column). *Note: Implemented RangeConfig model with StrictFloat and field validators enforcing min<max; TDD cycles completed for config validation.*
- [x] Red-Green-Refactor for core tests in `tests/methods/test_range/test_detector.py` (e.g., `detect` for out-of-range/NaNs, config validation). *Note: Cycle complete; wrote 15 failing tests (Red), implemented RangeDetector (Green), all tests pass with additional test for exclusivity (16/16); includes config validation with Pydantic ValidationError for missing/invalid min/max and StrictFloat for non-float rejection.*
- [x] Implement `biv/methods/range/detector.py` (subclass `BaseDetector` with pydantic config). *Note: Tests passing? All 16 tests pass after implementation and change to exclusive bounds; includes detect logic for flagging (series < min) | (series > max), handling NaN correctly (False), Integrated pydantic for config validation with clear errors.**
- [x] Red-Green-Refactor for edge cases: Zero values, extremes, config errors, non-health columns. *Note: Cycles complete; edge tests for zero/extreme values, empty DataFrames, large/small floats, config errors (min>max, missing keys/values), and DataFrame immutability included and passing.*
- [x] Refactor: Optimize for usability; run quality checks (per guide). *Note: Linting passes; code refactored for modularity (pydantic v2 best practices); all quality checks (mypy, ruff, pytest) pass.*
